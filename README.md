# TeleOp_Mecanum
This is a TeleOp program that I wrote to control the Mecanum wheels.

This program uses four independent motors, one per wheel.

Setup in the config files in the phone as shown:

front right drive motor = frd

front left drive motor = fld

back right drive motor = brd

back left drive motor = bld
